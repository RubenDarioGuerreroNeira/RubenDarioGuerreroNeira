### Medical Appointment API Features:
User Management (Patients, Doctors, Administrators):

The API allows registration, authentication, and management of users with different roles (patient, doctor, administrator).
A role-based system controls permissions and access to different functionalities.
Appointment Creation and Management:

Patients can request appointments with specific doctors, selecting date and time based on doctor availability.
Appointment status (confirmed, canceled, completed) is managed through an enum system, enabling precise tracking of the appointment flow.
Medical History Management:

Each patient's medical history is recorded, including descriptions, diagnoses, treatments, and complex medical data in JSONB format for easy searching and analysis.
The API provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries in the medical history.
It correctly relates entries to the corresponding patient and associated doctor.
Prescription Management:

Integrates with prescription management, including medication lists, indications, and issuance date.
Allows associating prescriptions with specific appointments.
Includes the possibility of storing the URL of a prescription file.
Medical Note Registration:

Facilitates the creation and management of medical notes associated with appointments.
Offers the option to mark notes as private to control access to sensitive information.
Consultation Document Storage:

Allows uploading and managing documents related to consultations, including file name, document type, file URL, and upload date.
These documents are associated with specific appointments.
Doctor's Schedule Management:

Doctor availability schedules are managed using JSONB format to represent the complexity of schedules.
This enables efficient searching for availability and appointment scheduling.
Technologies and Tools:

Telegram Bot for Medical Assistance
This Telegram bot is designed to provide users with quick and easy access to medical assistance. It integrates three key features:

GPS-Based Medical Center Locator:

Using your device's GPS, the bot identifies your current location.
It then searches for the nearest medical centers, such as hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies.
The bot provides a list of nearby options, including addresses and contact information.
AI-Powered Symptom Checker and Medical Information:

You can describe your symptoms or ask medical-related questions in natural language.
The bot uses an integrated AI to understand your queries and provide relevant information.
It can offer potential diagnoses, suggest home remedies, or advise seeking professional medical help.
Appointment Scheduling via RESTful API:

The bot connects to a RESTful API that manages medical appointment scheduling.
You can view available time slots at nearby medical centers.
You can book, reschedule, or cancel appointments directly through the bot.
Benefits
Convenience: Access medical assistance and schedule appointments from anywhere using your Telegram app.
Speed: Quickly find nearby medical centers and get answers to your medical questions.
Accuracy: Benefit from an AI-powered symptom checker that provides reliable information.
Efficiency: Streamline the process of finding medical care and scheduling appointments.
How to Use
Add the bot to your Telegram contacts.
Use commands or natural language to interact with the bot.
Allow the bot to access your location for the medical center locator feature.
Additional Notes
The bot is continuously updated with the latest medical information and improved AI capabilities.
User privacy is a priority; location data is only used to find nearby medical centers and is not stored long-term.

NestJS: Node.js framework for building scalable and maintainable applications.
TypeORM: ORM for interacting with the database, simplifying entity and relationship management.
PostgreSQL: Robust relational database for storing information.
JSONB: Format for storing complex data and performing efficient searches.
UUID: Utilization of UUIDs as unique identifiers for entities.
Focus on Efficiency and Scalability:

The API design prioritizes efficiency in data handling, especially for managing medical histories, schedules, and complex medical data.
The use of JSONB allows for optimized searches and queries.
The NestJS architecture and code modularity promote scalability and long-term maintainability.
